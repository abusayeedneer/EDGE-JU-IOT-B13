Agriculture and forestry are the backbone of many economies, providing food, raw materials, and ecological stability.
However, plant health is continuously threatened by environmental stressors, pests, diseases, and climate change.
Traditional plant health monitoring methods rely on manual observation, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often prone to inaccuracies. 
To overcome these challenges, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in plant health monitoring has emerged as a transformative solution.
